xisofs v1.3 (c) Copyright 1997 Steve Sherwood
---------------------------------------------

xisofs is a Perl/Tk interface to mkisofs and cdwrite/cdrecord. It will 
allow you to build an ISO9660 filesystem (via mkisofs) and write this to 
a blank CD-ROM (via cdwrite/cdrecord).

Requirements
------------

Perl v5.004
ptk v400.202
mkisofs v1.11
cdwrite v2.0 / cdrecord v1.5

All of the above software needs to be compiled and installed for xisofs
to work correctly (Although if cdwrite or cdrecord are not installed, 
xisofs will still allow you to create ISO9660 filesystems).
