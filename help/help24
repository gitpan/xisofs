This field specifies the path and filename of the boot catalog to used when making an "El Torito" bootable CD. The pathname must be relative to the source path specified. This option is required to make a bootable CD. This file will be created by mkisofs in the source filesystem, so be sure the specified filename does not conflict with an existing file as it is quietly overwritten. Usually a name like "boot.catalog" is chosen.
