xisofs v1.2 (c) Copyright 1997 Steve Sherwood
---------------------------------------------

xisofs is a Perl/Tk interface to mkisofs and cdwrite/cdrecord. It will 
allow you to build an ISO9660 filesystem (via mkisofs) and write this to 
a blank CD-ROM (via cdwrite/cdrecord).

Requirements
------------

Perl v5.004
ptk v400.202
mkisofs v1.11
cdwrite v2.0 / cdrecord v1.4

All of the above software needs to be compiled and installed for xisofs
to work correctly (Although if cdwrite is not installed, xisofs will still
allow you to create ISO9660 filesystems).

Installation
------------

To install this software, simply edit the file install.pl and change the
destination directories as required, save it and run. This will copy the
scripts to the xisofs lib directoty which you have specified and pre-process
the main file with the required directories.

Running
-------

To run xisofs, ensure that X11 is running and type 'xisofs'. If you have not 
run xisofs before, a file in the home directory will be created called
'.xisofsrc' which contains defaults and configuration information.
